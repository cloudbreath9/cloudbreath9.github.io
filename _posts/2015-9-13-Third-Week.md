title: Third Week
---

The mistake of procrastinating over the Labor Day weekend cost my very dearly. Thursday ended up being intensely stressful, spending about four hours straight following the instructions on the project. As foretold by Downing, most of the time spent on the project was not on coding the solution itself, but on the surrounding software engineering elements, such as Github issues, Travis CI, and writing unit/acceptance tests. As a result, I feel that I’ve gained a better grasp on common industry practices.

On Wednesday, ex-student Chris Martin came in and talked about his path to working at Bloomberg and what his job was like. It was interesting to hear things from the perspective of someone not too far removed from our current situation, and it was certainly nice to have a better understanding of what could come after college. 

I enjoyed the lecture on C++ exceptions on Friday. Downing formalized the intended use of an exception, which is to force the caller of the code to either handle any problem that arises or pass on handling of the problem to its own caller. I didn’t quite understand C++ exceptions very well before; I didn’t know C++ lets you throw just about any data type! Still, other than that, exceptions in C++ function quite similarly to how Java’s exceptions work, which I am quite familiar with. 

The outside readings this week were over pair programming, spouting off praise for how effective it was. I have had some experience with it in my Data Structures class, which allowed me to better understand the arguments the papers made in favor of pair programming. The next project will allow pair programming, so I’m looking forwards to seeing how this experience will turn out!

Tip of the week:

Please, please don’t procrastinate.
