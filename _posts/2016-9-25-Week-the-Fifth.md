title: Week the Fourth

* What did you do this past week?

Career fair was this week! I managed talk to a bunch of companies and snag a lot of free swag while I was at it! I also found a fantastic software consulting comapny called Thoughtworks that has a very inclusive environment, and I want to work there. In the meantime, I'm interviewing with several other companies to brush up on my interviewing skills and see if I can get offers and negotiate. As for this class, my teammate and I finished the implementation on Sunday, but didn't do testing until Thursday.

* What's in your way?

My sleep schedule has not yet been fixed, as I keep occasionally getting insomnia (I blame stress). There's a deadline coming up for my 2D Game Development Capstone course on Wednesday, and I'll be working extra hard on that.

* What will you do next week?

Continue to attend classes! I'll be working a lot on the Captone project until Wednesday. My classes have settled down into a pretty stable routine, so I am going to try to put some time into my BDP Creative Project that I'm required to do this semester. I should also find a partner for the next project!

In Monday's lecture, we wrote Python's reduce method as an exercise, which was mildly interesting. We also covered how iterators work in Python, which intrigued me (learning about Python's magic inner workings always intrigues me). On Wednesday, Alex Menzies from JPL came and talked about similar things to the Bloomberg talk last week, talking a lot about agile programming. He showed a really cool demo using the Hololenses! That was certainly a highlight of that day! I missed Friday's lecture due to a bout of insomnia Thursday night.

Tip of the week: Write down people's names and basic information about them! Networking will always be a strong component of finding a job, so it's a good habit to keep track of the people you meet!
