title: Fouth Week
---

The outside readings this week revolved around software bugs in rocket ships, namely the Mariner 1 and the Ariane 5. In the Mariner 1, the omission of a hyphen in a line of code caused data to be read incorrectly, leading to unnecessary course corrections that forced operators to destroy the rocket. With the Ariane 5, a conversion of a 64-bit number to a 16-bit value, causing the rocket to veer off-course and triggering a self-destruct mechanism. It simply goes to show how even the smallest of bugs can have enormous consequences. Tying this back to the previous week’s readings, I wonder if these tiny yet catastrophic bugs could be prevented with the live code reviewing done in pair programming.

This week’s classes have focused on the usage of pointers, references, and arrays as well as the pre-increment and post-increment operators. I already understood most of the concepts regarding these things, so I didn’t get much out of these lectures other than a more formal notion of when to use each one. One thing that was new to me, however, was the difference between r-values and l-values: l-values have a place in memory, while r-values do not and are temporary.

The new project is much more technically involved than the first one, though we get to have a partner to pair program with on this one. I haven’t been able to schedule very much time with my partner so far, however, so the progress of this project is a bit worrying. Hopefully we can get this done by Thursday. 

Tip of the week: 

Consider getting to know the tools you use a bit better. Poke around in settings, figure out what refactoring tools your IDE or text editor has, and search online for more tips. Often you’ll find things that are a boon to your productivity and eliminate a lot of annoyance!
