title: Hello World!

So a new semester begins, and I begin my journey into Downing’s CS371p!

I was a bit wary of the workload when first taking a look at the syllabus: about 24 hours of work a week, and 7000 total lines of code in C++, a language I’ve not used very much. I’m not sure how well it’ll meld with a tough 17-hour semester, but the course materials look solid, and it’s a subject I’m definitely interested in. Plus, I’m sure both the OOP and C++ skills will come in handy when I take the dive into industry after college.

I've really enjoyed Downing's first two lectures; they progress smoothly at a good pace, and everything is explained very clearly and precisely. At the beginning of every lecture, there is (or at least will be) an attendance check and a quiz done through TopHat. Although having to pay for this service is a bit annoying, its system looks elegant; attendance is completed within seconds, and the quizzes will probably also be quiet expedient. So far, it seems that the lectures are mainly composed of Downing going through code and describing what it does in order to illustrate topics, such as usage of assertions and gtest. When going through the code, he randomly picks people out of the class roster to explain some lines to the class. I think this is an excellent way of pushing class participation; Downing works with the student he calls out to describe what the code does, why it’s doing what it’s doing, and what goes on behind the scenes.

All in all, I’m really looking forward to this class and the challenges it will pose.

Tip of the week:

Look into different VCSes and build automation tools. Some might fit your needs better than others!
