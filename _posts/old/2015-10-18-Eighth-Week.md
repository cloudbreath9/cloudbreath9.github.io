title: Eighth Week

Finally got the exam scores back, I’m pretty pleased with what I got. It seems that I made a few careless mistakes somewhere, though. But enough of exams, on to the actual class material! On Monday, we went over Allocator, the new project. I’m personally very confused as to why we are assigned this; the class is called Object-Oriented Programming, after all, and managing a heap doesn’t exactly lend itself to that. I can understand that most of the standard library’s container classes use Allocators and that figuring out how Allocators work is beneficial to working with these container classes, but I feel that this project is simply redundant, especially since many of us have already written heaps in 429 and/or 439. Those classes are much better suited for this topic, anyways, and they are already prerequisites for the class! I think this project really should have been replaced with something that teaches more about object-oriented design.

The two lectures this week were pretty interesting. We went over arrays again on Wednesday, further pointing out their tricky nuances. A lot of the lecture felt like review since we’ve been over arrays a few times, though the case of instantiating an array allocated for a parent class with instances of a child class with a larger size was interesting; it certainly seems like an easy opportunity for bugs to sneak into the code. Friday’s lecture also taught me about how multiple declarations of a function with different default parameters will union with each other to include all mentioned default parameters unless there’s a conflict.

All in all, this week was pretty lax. It looks like we’ll be going over the friend keyword next week though, so I’m looking forward to learning about that!

Tip of the week:

Hackathons and game jams are great ways to put your coding skills and creativity to the test and improve upon them. Go to one every so often to keep your mind nimble and your thinking sharp!
