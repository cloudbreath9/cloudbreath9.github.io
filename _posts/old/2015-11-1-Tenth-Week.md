title: Tenth Week

This week’s articles were absolutely fascinating to me. I was taught getters and setters in high school, and I never really gave it much thought. After reading these articles and pondering on the issue, though, I can’t believe I never questioned them. They fly right in the face of object-oriented design! These articles really drove home the essence of object-oriented design for me. Objects ask for behavior, not data. Doing so decouples the data from the behavior, allowing for more modular designs that are more flexible when change inevitably happens. Learning about this concept is probably the highpoint of this course for me; I feel so much more enlightened about the fundamentals object-oriented design now.

The real challenge was applying these ideas to the Darwin project. In the end, I think my partner and I got a good system going with objects asking other objects to execute behavior and calculate positions and whatnot, though it took quite a while to hash the design out. In fact, the design portion was probably the most time-consuming part of the project.

For lectures this week, Monday was spent going over the new project, Conrad Stoll from Mutual Mobile came on Wednesday to talk about his work there, and Downing spoke about the C++ STL’s stack implementation, which I found a bit odd. I’m used to Java’s stack, whose pop method returns the item that was popped. I can see how the C++ implementation is more performance-oriented, but I prefer the convenience of the Java implementation

Tip of the week: Infinifactory and Spacechem are pretty neat games that deal with concurrency issues. I’d recommend playing them if you have some spare time!
