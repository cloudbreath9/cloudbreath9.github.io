title: Sixth Week

Man, these weeks seem to be blazing by fast. I’m glad I didn’t have to worry about a project this week because of the test coming up next week, so that was certainly a nice change of pace.

I really like the concepts we’re working with now, which involve iterators, lambdas, and generics. I’ve been really intrigued by the differing levels of iterators and how the level required is specified simply by the operators used. Although this seems convenient, I am a bit wary of its maintainability and clearness; one would have to manually document the level of iterator required by a method. Lambdas have also proved really interesting, especially since I have never used them. The ability to capture variables and then pass the function around is fascinating. The syntax is a bit confusing, but I think I’ll grow to like this feature. I am unable to judge how it compares to lambdas in other languages, however, as I’ve never used lambdas before. I like how generics in C++ seem much more flexible than they are in Java, though I feel like that’s once again a tradeoff between rigorousness of correctness at compile-time and ease of programming. 

The quizzes have been getting more technical a tricky recently. I’ve really had to start reviewing my notes in order to get these right. Nonetheless, the quizzes remain relevant and helpful to understanding useful things in C++.

Tip of the week:

This one’s pretty generic: Challenge yourself. Keep pushing the limits of what you think you can accomplish, keep poking at what you think you might and might not be able to do. You never know where that will get you!
