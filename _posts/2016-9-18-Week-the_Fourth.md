title: Week the Fourth

* What did you do this past week?

I (mostly) caught up on all my work, which was pretty stressful. I made headway on the project for this class, but not so much on my 2d Game Dev Capstone project.

* What's in your way?

Primarily a non-existent sleep schedule. Career fair is on Tuesday, too, and since having a job after graduation would be pretyt nice, I'm going to be spending quite a bit of time preparing for that.

* What will you do next week?

Wrap up the Netflix project with my partner and continue to crank through the bits of work I'm still behind on (mainly with the 2D Game Dev Capstone class. Afterwards, I want to take a little time for myself. These past two weeks have been particularly stressful, and I think I'll dedicate a day this weekend to myself.

On Monday, we discussed the Netflix project some more, this time focusing on caching things like average ratings per customer and per movie. This topic was pretty thought-provoking; what other things could you cache that could possibly improve your RMSE? On Wednesday, former student Chris Martin came to give a talk about working at Bloomberg. I'd heard this talk already in Downing's OOP class a year ago, so I ended up spacing out quite a bit, which did not bode well for Friday's quiz over what tools Bloomberg used. Friday was a pretty basic overview of operators in Python, which was fairly dry to me.

Tip of the week: Even when you're hacking out some experimental code, do attempt to maintain code quality and practice good programming habits. I find that "lazy" experimental coding bleeds into serious coding often, and you never know when experimental code ends up turning into actual code.
