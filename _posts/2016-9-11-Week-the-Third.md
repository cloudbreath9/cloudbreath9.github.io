* What did you do this past week?

I got sick and fell behind in all my classes! Huzzah! Maybe interacting with thousands of con attendees will do that to me. Being sick meant that I had a lovely time wrapping up the Collatz project (it was miserable), though I did manage to get it in on time. The majority of my time was spent setting up Docker, as I had neglected to follow the official instructions. Luckily, as I moved on with the actual project, I remembered a lot of what I did back in Downing's OOP class, and that made it a lot easier.

* What's in your way?

I've got to catch up on all the work I've not done this week due to the sickness. The apartment I live in is also missing some furniture, so I need to take care of that this weekend.

* What will you do next week?

Continue to flesh out my Netflix solution with my pair programming partner. We have the basics down and are ready to move towards a working solution.

Being sick, I did not go to class on Wednesday. I decided to show up on Friday, though, as I was feeling slightly better. In this lecture, Downing covered some fascinating things about Python literals, like how small integers were cached and always shared memory addresses. We also went over built-in types and their relationships via isinstance and issubclass. It's really interesting days like these that make me glad I took this course!

Tip of the week: If you're into low-level coding challenges and optimization, TIS-100 might be a cool game for you! It's only about $7 and is entirely about solving coding challenges with an assembly language.
