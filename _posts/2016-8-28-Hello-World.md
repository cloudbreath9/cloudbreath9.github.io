I'm back for more! Another semester, another blog. Here goes my foray into Downing’s CS373 (and hopes that I finish this blog this time)!

This past week has mostly consisted of moving into my apartment and trying to figure out which classes I'm actually taking. I'm mostly moved in and just need to tidy a few things up, and I think my course sechedule is fairly stable by now. The main thing in my way is my own tendency to procrastinate. It's screwed me over quite a few times, but I feel like I've gotten better at finding ways to deal with it, and I'll continue to improve my ways. Next week, I'll really settle into the school routine and try to see where I can budget time for volunteering, which is something I'd like to do this semester (I'll be working with [LifeWorks](http://www.lifeworksaustin.org/) and [Out Youth](http://www.outyouth.org/)). I'll also be preparing for my trip to San Japan this next weekend!

The format of the class is familiar to me, as I took OOP from Downing last fall. As before, the lectures progress smoothly at a good pace, and everything is explained very clearly and precisely. I find that Downing's style of walking through code and asking students to explain it thoroughly is quite nice and works very well. The daily quizes are something I've gotten used to, and are a good checkup on whether or not you've digested the last lecture and the assigned readings.

All in all, I’m really looking forward to this class and the challenges it will pose.

Tip of the week:

Look into different VCSes and build automation tools. Some might fit your needs better than others!
