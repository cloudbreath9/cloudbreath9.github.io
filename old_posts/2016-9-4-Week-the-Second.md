title: Week the Second

* What did you do this past week?

In the past week, I finalized my classes and caught up on my new online Information classes and did a lot of work for the 2D Game Development Capstone (the fastest-paced course I've taken at UT yet!). I also went to San Japan (an anime convention) and helped a friend table a booth in the Artist Alley there. I sold lots of things, bought some cool stuff for friends, and got bodied in a Smash 4 tournament (rip).

* What's in your way?

The stress of getting things done before the San Japan weekend hit caused me to lose some sleep, and my tendency to procrastinate is still there. I have been rather disorganized since school started, too. It looks like juggling three projects simultaneously (Software Engineering, 2D Game Development Capstone, and my BDP creative project) while taking two writing-intensive online courses is going to take a lot of organization, so I better get on that!

* What will you do next week?

I think I've settled on my organization methods, so I'm going to invest a bit of time into organizing my time better. I also have other things to do in the meantime, like an essay that's due tomorrow, discussions for my online classes that I have to participate in, and the project for this class that still needs to be done. On the living space side of things, I have to tidy up my room more and help my roommates buy some more furniture for the living room, as I am the one with the car. Overall, it looks like another busy week is ahead of me!

In class this past week, we went over the first project. Downing showed us many of the steps that we will be taking for the project, and I feel like this is a good way of getting everyone on the same page. I was unable to make it to the Friday lecture due to San Japan, unfortunately.

Tip of the week: I might as well plug Hackerrank, since they've been sending me quite a few emails recently asking me to solve some problems that I have yet to find the time to solve. It's a very nice site for testing and improving your problem solving skills and knowledge of algorithms and whatnot!
