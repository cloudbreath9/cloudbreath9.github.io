title: Second Week

With the second week came readings and discussion about the first project. We had two sets of readings due, the first on Wednesday and the second on Friday. This seems to be the pattern for the rest of the semester. The first set of readings comprised of a blog post on advice for computer science college students, an article on how to be happy in college, and a brief guide on git. These readings were short and sweet, and I enjoyed them. The second reading was from our textbook, which is actually quite interesting and not very dry. The forty pages assigned from it, while daunting at first, went by fairly quickly.

The in-class quizzes that followed these readings were very easy if one did the readings, covering only the concepts presented by the readings and the main points covered in the previous class. I feel that they are entirely reasonable if one pays attentions to the lectures and is not asleep while doing the readings.

Downing mainly went over the first project this week, and it seems fairly involved. We must mimic a lot of software engineering procedures commonly practiced in the industry, such as using an issue tracker, designing acceptance and unit tests, utilizing continuous integration, and writing documentation. I’m really enjoying the chance to practice these processes in an academic setting.

I’ve not yet started the project yet, but I’m planning on spending all of my Labor Day doing it. Hopefully I won’t run into too many roadblocks.

Tip of the week:

There’s this cool game called TIS-100. “It’s the assembly language programming game you never asked for!” It involves programming solutions using twelve nodes that run in parallel, connected by ports and executing RIS assembly. I’d definitely recommend it if you’re looking for a low-level challenge!
