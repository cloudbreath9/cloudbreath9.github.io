Hi! I'm Ben "Linguini" Lin, I'm from Houston, and I use they/them pronouns. I'm a 4th year CS major who hasn't really decided what area of CS they're interested in. I've interned at Google twice and am currently looking to take a full-time job in Austin. I have way too many video games, love Steven Universe, read some webcomics, enjoy board games, and like having thoughtful conversations.
